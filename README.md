# PRODIGY_DS_03
Description: In Task 3, I built a decision tree classifier to predict based on their demographic and behavioral data. Utilizing Python and machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, I trained a decision tree model on the provided dataset. I split the dataset into training and testing sets, evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics, and fine-tuned the model parameters to optimize its predictive accuracy.

Key Insights:

Constructed a decision tree model to classify into categories.
Examined the importance of different features .
Optimized model performance through parameter tuning and cross-validation techniques.
